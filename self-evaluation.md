1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?  
I feel pretty good about Arrays after doing the assignment. I got stuck on the boolean array question and reached out to Nicole who confirmed that I was overthinking it. I thought it might require some deeper programming that we hadn't learned yet. But overall, feeling good about arrays.  
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?  
I would like to understand more of the simple syntax like when to add a space and why does there need to be a semicolon. I'll look that up after finishing the rest of my assignments.  
3. What questions do you have about Arrays?  
I have a lot of questions that stem more from curiousity about various other methods and deeper uses for things like booleans which I'm sure we will get to!
